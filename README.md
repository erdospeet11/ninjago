# NinjaGo


## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Documentation for the classes and functions

You can access it locally with the following command:

```
godoc -http=:[port]
```

## Getting started

```
git clone https://szofttech.inf.elte.hu/szofttech-c-2024/group-08/ninjago.git

go get .

go run .
```

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.
